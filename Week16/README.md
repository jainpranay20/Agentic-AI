## ✍️ Start With What a Model Actually Is

**Analogy:** Think of an LLM like a **brilliant recipe writer with no kitchen**. They can describe the perfect dish in exhaustive, mouth-watering detail. They still can't cook it, plate it, or carry it to your table — someone with hands has to actually do that part.

An LLM is, at its core, a very good next-word predictor. Give it text, it gives you back more text — one plausible word after another. That's genuinely all it does:

- It can write you a perfect email. **It cannot send one.**
- It can hand you working code. **It cannot run it.**
- It can describe exactly what should happen next. **It cannot make that thing happen.**

> *"Writing the perfect email isn't the goal — having it sent is. We want the model to take the next step too, not just describe it."*

## 🤝 What "Hands" Actually Means

**Analogy:** Think of this like a **waiter who knows the specials and can place the order**. Knowing today's specials (context) is only half the job. Being able to actually walk the order into the kitchen (a tool) is the other half. A waiter missing either one is just standing there.

Giving a model "hands" comes down to two ingredients working together. Neither one alone is enough:

| Component | What It Means | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Context** | Real, current information | What's actually in your inbox right now. What's really on your calendar today. |
| **Tools** | A way to actually act | A button it's allowed to press: send this email, save this file, book this slot. |

**Put plainly:** Context + Tools = a model that can finish what it starts. That combination is exactly what MCP standardizes.

## 🧮 How This Used to Get Built

**Analogy:** Think of the old way like **every restaurant building its own delivery fleet**. If every single restaurant in town had to design, build, and maintain its own custom delivery vans from scratch, most of the work would be identical — reinvented, badly, over and over.

### The Old Way: Wire Each API in By Hand

Before any of this was standardized, giving an AI app a "hand" meant a developer writing custom connector code straight to that one API.

```
🤖 AI App ⟷ Gmail API
```

One straight wire, one app, one API. Simple — for exactly this one pair.

**The Problem:** Add more apps, add more tools, and you get:

```
N apps × M tools = N × M custom integrations
```

| | What was genuinely fine | Where it broke down |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Super easy to define for one app, one API | Every team rebuilds the same wrapper, again and again |
| ✅ | Easy to understand — it's just a direct wire | Redundant, and fragile the moment the API changes |

> *"At its heart, it's just a thin wrapper around an API."*

---

## 🧰 The Actual Definition — MCP in One Sentence

**Analogy:** Think of MCP like a **standard plug, not a custom cable for every socket**. Once every appliance and every socket agrees on one plug shape, nobody needs a custom adapter per device. Build the plug once — it just works everywhere.

> **MCP — the Model Context Protocol — is a shared, standard way for AI apps to find and use tools, without every single app rebuilding the same wrapper from scratch.**

Not a new kind of AI, not a new model — just an agreed-upon shape for "here are the actions and information I'm offering," that any AI app can plug into the same way.

### Before MCP vs. After MCP

| Before MCP | After MCP |
|---|---|
| AI App ⟷ Gmail API | AI App ⟷ MCP Server ⟷ Gmail API |
| N × M integrations | N + M integrations |

**The simplest pitch:** MCP is just a shared toolbox — a standard-shaped collection of tools and APIs that any AI model can reach into, instead of every developer building their own private toolbox from scratch.

## 🔧 What a Server Actually Offers

**Analogy:** Think of this like **the menu, the reservation book, and the specials card**. Tools are what you can order. Resources are the reservation book you're allowed to check. Prompts are the pre-written specials card suggesting what to order — three different kinds of help, from one restaurant.

Every MCP server speaks the same three words. Learn these three, and you can read what any MCP server does at a glance:

### 🔧 Tools
Actions the model is allowed to trigger — the "hands." Anything with a side effect. Something actually happens in the real world when this runs.

**Example — A Gmail server's tools:**
- `send_email(to, subject, body)`
- `read_email(id)`
- `draft_email(to, subject, body)`
- `delete_email(id)`

### 📄 Resources
Read-only data the model can pull in as context — nothing changes when it reads one. Just information. Looking at it changes nothing, the same way reading a menu does not place an order.

**Example — A Gmail server's resources:**
- `email_thread(id)` → full conversation text
- `calendar_day(date)` → today's events
- `file(path)` → document contents

### 📋 Prompts
Ready-made instruction templates the server offers, so users do not start from a blank page. A pre-written recipe card, not a raw ingredient — a shortcut to a good starting instruction.

**Example — A Gmail server's prompts:**
- `summarize_thread(thread_id)`
- `draft_reply(tone: "formal" | "casual")`
- `weekly_digest()`

## 🔗 Who's Actually Talking to Whom

**Analogy:** Think of this like **you, the waiter, and the kitchen phone line**. You (the Host) speak to the waiter (the Client), who calls the kitchen (the Server) down a phone line built for exactly this (the protocol). You never dial the kitchen yourself.

MCP always involves the same three roles:

```
Host ⟷ Client ⟷ Server
```

| Role | What It Is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Host** | The app you're using | Claude Desktop, Cursor, n8n |
| **Client** | Speaks the protocol | Runs inside the Host |
| **Server** | Exposes tools/resources/prompts | Gmail MCP Server, GitHub MCP Server |

### The Round Trip

1. **You, in Claude Desktop:** "Send the team an email about tomorrow's meeting."
2. **The Host runs an MCP Client:** Claude Desktop is the Host. It keeps an MCP Client that knows how to speak the protocol.
3. **The Client calls the Server:** Over stdio (local) or Streamable HTTP (remote) — the same request shape either way.
4. **The Server calls the real API:** The Gmail MCP Server translates the request into an actual Gmail API call.
5. **The result flows all the way back:** Gmail confirms, the Server replies, the Client hands it to Claude, and Claude tells you it is sent.

**Transport:** stdio (local) or Streamable HTTP (remote) — runs on JSON-RPC 2.0 underneath.

> *"Because the Client/Server boundary is standardized, the same Gmail MCP Server works whether the Host asking is Claude Desktop, Cursor, or a custom n8n node — nobody had to rebuild the phone line."*

## ⚖️ The Honest Comparison — Before vs. After

Neither approach is a trap and neither is perfect. Here's the honest trade-off, pros and cons both included.

| Aspect | Before MCP | After MCP |
|---|---|---|
| **What it looks like** | AI App ⟷ Gmail API | AI App ⟷ MCP Server ⟷ Gmail API |
| **What's good** | + Super easy to define<br>+ Easily understandable | + Easy to access and define, once<br>+ Scalable across any number of apps<br>+ No redundant wrapper code<br>+ One connection reaches every common tool and app<br>+ Far less prone to breaking |
| **The trade-offs** | - Duplicate code, written by everyone, in every project<br>- Redundant, and prone to breaking whenever the API changes<br>- At its core, just a thin wrapper around one API | - A little more complex to set up initially<br>- Many servers still run locally, for now<br>- Less obvious at first exactly what the end goal is |

**The honest read:** For a one-off script that will only ever call one API, wiring it by hand is still completely reasonable. MCP earns its keep the moment more than one app, or more than one tool, enters the picture — which, in practice, is almost immediately.

## 🔎 A Pattern You've Already Met — Search

**Analogy:** Think of search like a **waiter checking with the supplier**. When a waiter calls the supplier to check if a fish is in stock, it doesn't feel magical — it's a normal question with a normal answer. Search works the same way: ask, get a current answer back.

It's easy to assume search deserves its own separate explanation — Claude searching the web can feel like a different kind of magic than Claude sending an email. It isn't. It's the exact same Tool primitive: one input and one output, offered by a search MCP server the same way an email server offers `send_email`.

```
A search server's one tool:

Tool: search(q: string) -> results[]
input:  q = "latest AI agent news"
output: [{ title, url, snippet }, ...]
```

> *"Once you see search this way, every new MCP server you meet gets easier to size up: what's the tool, what goes in, what comes back — same three questions, every single time."*

---

## 🧩 Where This Already Lives

**Analogy:** Think of this like **one trained waiter, ten different kitchens**. A waiter who's learned to work one particular kitchen's ticket system can walk into any restaurant that uses that same system and start taking orders immediately — no retraining needed.

The identical protocol is what connects Claude to dozens of completely unrelated products:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Communication** | Gmail, Slack |
| **Development** | GitHub, Playwright, Context7 |
| **Data** | Postgres, Supabase, Google Drive |
| **Team & Ops** | Linear, Sentry, Notion |
| **Business** | Stripe, HubSpot, Salesforce |

**Ecosystem by 2026:**
- 70+ servers, 11 categories
- 30 connect instantly by URL alone
- MCP Apps let tools show real UI in Claude's chat

> *"Once Claude Desktop or Claude Code understands MCP, adding a new capability is rarely custom engineering — it's usually just connecting one more server from a catalog that already exists."*

### The Most Popular Servers (Real Production Setups)

| Server | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **GitHub** | Pull requests, issues, and code search |
| **Playwright** | Drives a real browser — click, fill forms, test a live site |
| **Context7** | Fetches current, version-specific docs |
| **Postgres / Supabase** | Query a real database directly |
| **Slack** | Search threads, summarize channels, post updates |
| **Linear** | Create issues, update status, track a sprint |
| **Sentry** | Check for new errors since yesterday's deploy |
| **Notion** | Read and write pages directly |
| **Stripe** | Pull billing and payment context |

> *"A great kitchen doesn't own every gadget in the catalog — it has the handful of reliable tools the chef actually reaches for every single service."*

---

## 📦 The Other Direction — You Can Be the Server Too

**Analogy:** Think of this like **publishing your recipe to every kitchen in town at once**. Instead of teaching one restaurant at a time how to make your dish, you publish the recipe in a format every kitchen already knows how to read — one write-up, adopted everywhere, instantly.

Everything so far has been about connecting Claude to other products. The reverse is just as valuable — and it's the reason companies like Stripe, Linear, Notion, and HubSpot all shipped their own official MCP servers.

> *"If you've built a product, exposing it as an MCP server means every MCP-speaking AI app can now use it, without you building a single custom integration for each one."*

### A Concrete Example

Say you've built a small project-tracking app. Expose three tools once:

```
create_task(title, project)
list_tasks(project, status)
update_status(task_id, status)
```

That's it. Claude Desktop can now manage tasks in your app by chat. So can Cursor. So can Claude Code, or any future AI tool that speaks MCP — all from the same three functions, built once.

| Without Your Own Server | With Your Own MCP Server |
|---|---|
| Every AI app needs its own custom integration | Build the three tools once |
| Built and maintained by someone — usually you | Every current and future MCP-speaking AI app gets access on day one |

> *"The moment your product has an MCP server, it stops being something a user has to explain to Claude — Claude already knows the shape, because it's the same shape as every other server it's ever connected to."*

---

## 📝 See It Built, Line by Line

**Analogy:** Think of this like **handing the waiter a new instruction card**. You're not rebuilding the restaurant — you're handing the waiter one new instruction card: here's a dish you're now allowed to actually carry out, not just describe on the menu.

### A Real `send_email` Tool — In About Ten Lines

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
mcp = FastMCP("gmail-sender")

@mcp.tool()
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str:
    """Actually sends an email, unlike the draft-only default."""
    gmail_api.send(to=to, subject=subject, body=body)
    return f"Sent to {to}"
```

| Line | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `@mcp.tool()` | Marks this function as something Claude is allowed to call |
| The description | Tells the model exactly what this tool does, in plain English |
| `gmail_api.send(...)` | The one line that actually presses send — the part the official draft-only tool skips |

### Why This Matters

As of now, Claude's built-in Gmail connector can create and save a draft — it deliberately stops short of pressing send, as a safety choice.

- **The official tool:** Safe by default. A human reviews and sends. Great for most day-to-day use.
- **A custom MCP server:** Genuine `send_email` tool, wired with your own permission and safeguards, for workflows where waiting on a human doesn't fit.

> *"The official connector chose caution. A custom server you build and control can choose differently — the whole point is showing exactly how small that gap is to close."*
